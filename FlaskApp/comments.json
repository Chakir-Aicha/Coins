    {"comment": "Honestly, I get so demotivated when I put in all that research, set my trap, and wait for the perfect setup, only for it to just slip away. Like, BN didn’t show up, but of course, it magically appeared after expiry. Typical. But whatever, Nifty decided to be nice today. It’s totally fine to skip a trade on a bad setup.

Be rational, not reckless."},
